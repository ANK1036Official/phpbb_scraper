# phpbb_scraper

I wrote this scraper while doing research on illegal underground Tor forums.
It allowed me to extract passwords to archives that the users were sharing.
It also allowed me to archive all of the data for later analysis.

The code has been changed as not to leave any identifiers as to what forums these were targetting. This includes the cookies, hostnames, and login credentials hardcoded in for my memory (lol)

Please do not fix this code. And do not use this code for illegal purposes. 

The code itself targetted 3 distinct illegal forums, and in doing so, the content collected is also illegal in nature.

I am not responsible for what you do with this code.

Please read my full disclaimer in **DISCLAIMER.md**
